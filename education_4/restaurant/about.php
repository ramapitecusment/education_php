                design, vertical rhythm is the structure that guides a reader's eye through the content. Good
                vertical rhythm makes a layout more balanced and beautiful and its content more readable. The
                time signature in sheet music visually depicts a song's rhythm, while for us, the lines of the
                baseline grid depict the rhythm of our content and give us guidelines.</h3>
